 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *
 * 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 * $MATH:
 * Computers are fast, so we can implement this solution directly without any clever math.
 * However for the mathematically inclined, there are closed-form formulas:
 * s  = N(N + 1) / 2.
 * s2 = N(N + 1)(2N + 1) / 6.
 * Hence s^2 - s2 = (N^4 / 4) + (N^3 / 6) - (N^2 / 4) - (N / 6).
